🌟 Java Design Patterns
This repository is created to explain commonly used design patterns in Java. Design patterns provide general solutions to problems encountered during software development. These patterns help make your code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.

🔒 Singleton Pattern
Description:
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is often used to ensure that a class is instantiated only once and the same instance is used throughout the application.

Use Cases:

Configuration classes
Logging mechanisms
Connection pools

🏭 Factory Pattern
Description:
The Factory pattern abstracts the object creation process. This pattern allows you to decide dynamically which class instance to create. The Factory pattern makes your code more flexible and extensible.

Use Cases:

Complex object creation
Reducing dependencies
Providing abstraction

👁️‍🗨️ Observer Pattern
Description:
The Observer pattern allows an object to notify other objects when its state changes. This pattern is especially useful when an event affects multiple objects.

Use Cases:

Event-driven systems
Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture
Notification systems

🏗️ Builder Pattern
Description:
The Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step. It allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction process.

Use Cases:

Creating complex objects with many parameters
Constructing immutable objects
Reducing constructor overload

🧬 Prototype Pattern
Description:
The Prototype pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype. This pattern is useful when creating a new instance of a class is expensive or complex.

Use Cases:

Avoiding the cost of creating objects
Managing instances with variable state
Cloning objects with complex initialization

🌉 Bridge Pattern
Description:
The Bridge pattern separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. This pattern is useful when you need to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.

Use Cases:

Decoupling interface and implementation
Handling multiple implementations
Managing changes in both interface and implementation

🌿 Composite Pattern
Description:
The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern is useful when individual objects and compositions of objects should be treated uniformly.

Use Cases:

Representing part-whole hierarchies
Managing complex structures with simple interfaces
Treating individual and composite objects uniformly

🎭 Facade Pattern
Description:
The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. This pattern is useful when you want to hide the complexities of a system and expose only the necessary parts to the client.

Use Cases:

Simplifying complex systems
Hiding subsystem complexity
Providing a single entry point to a system

🪶 Flyweight Pattern
Description:
The Flyweight pattern minimizes memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects. This pattern is useful when a large number of objects must be created efficiently.

Use Cases:

Reducing memory usage in large systems
Managing many small, similar objects
Sharing common state among multiple objects

🛡️ Proxy Pattern
Description:
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern is useful when you need to control the creation, access, or modification of an object.

Use Cases:

Controlling access to an object
Lazy initialization
Remote object management

🔗 Chain of Responsibility Pattern
Description:
The Chain of Responsibility pattern passes a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

Use Cases:

Implementing a request processing pipeline
Decoupling senders and receivers
Handling requests in a flexible manner

⚙️ Command Pattern
Description:
The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Use Cases:

Implementing undo/redo functionality
Queuing and scheduling tasks
Logging and auditing user actions

🔤 Interpreter Pattern
Description:
The Interpreter pattern defines a grammar for interpreting a particular language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar. This pattern is useful when you need to interpret expressions in a language.

Use Cases:

Implementing scripting languages
Parsing expressions
Evaluating mathematical formulas

🔁 Iterator Pattern
Description:
The Iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

Use Cases:

Traversing collections
Providing a standard way to iterate over a collection
Implementing custom iteration logic

💾 Memento Pattern
Description:
The Memento pattern captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that it can be restored later without violating encapsulation. This pattern is useful when you need to save and restore an object's state.

Use Cases:

Implementing undo/redo functionality
Saving checkpoints in an application
Restoring objects to previous states

🔄 State Pattern
Description:
The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is useful when an object’s behavior depends on its state, and it needs to change its behavior at runtime.

Use Cases:

Managing object behavior based on state
Implementing state machines
Handling state-dependent workflows

📝 Template Pattern
Description:
The Template pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

Use Cases:

Defining the framework of an algorithm
Reusing common behavior across multiple classes
Customizing parts of an algorithm

🎯 Strategy Pattern
Description:
The Strategy pattern allows you to change the behavior of a class at runtime. It makes it possible to switch between different algorithms. This pattern makes your code more modular and testable.

Use Cases:

Choosing between different algorithms
Dynamic behavior changes
Independent business logic
